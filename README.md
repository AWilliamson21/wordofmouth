The initial commit for this repo is the result of CS 3240 (Advanced Software Development) at UVA. I worked with a group of 4 peers to create this website, although the history of the repo has been obscured to hide sensitive log-in information. The current result of this project is hosted at https://wordofmouth-b01.herokuapp.com/. It is a recipe site where Google users can log in and browse recipes and articles, post comments, and fork recipes. This code was produced using the Django framework and also utilizes Postgres, Bootstrap, django-allauth, and the Google Drive API. Run automated tests locally with "python manage.py test".
